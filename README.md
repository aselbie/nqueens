# What is this?

This is an appified, multi-threaded version of [bigthyme's n-queens algorithm](https://github.com/bigthyme/nQueens) with a front-end that will graph solve times for a series of 'n' values.

# Why does this exist?

I wanted to compare compute capabilities of various cloud platforms while scratching my itch to see how high of an 'n' I could solve. I summarize my findings in a [blog post](http://selbielabs.com/cloud-platforms-compared/).
